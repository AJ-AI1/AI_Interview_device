# AI_Interview_Aide_device

Project Overview
The AI_Interview_Aide_device helps job seekers or interviewee to rehearse interview questions tailored to specific roles, industries or skill sets with an interactive platform, Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP). This device delivers constructive feedback to users on their responses, helping them refine their communication skills and build interview confidence.

Objective
This project simulates realistic interview scenarios where users can:

Receive job-specific interview questions.
Practice structured responses in a simulated interview environment.
Obtain immediate feedback on their responses to enhance clarity, relevance, and structure.
Problem to Solve
Preparing for interviews can be challenging, especially when it comes to practicing verbal responses. Although many platforms provide written content, few offer real-time practice opportunities with feedback. This device addresses that gap by offering users a hands-on, interactive experience to improve verbal communication skills.
